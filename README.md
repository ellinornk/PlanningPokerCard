##### Very VERY important:
"Count to three, no more, no less. Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three."
 Holy Grail: The Screenplay, page 76.

### Assignment:
1. Select phase: You can select any card. When you select one, you will move on to the Waiting phase.

2. Waiting phase: Only show the chosen card with its backside up (awaiting others to choose a card using some similar app or actual cards). An simple interaction shall get you to Reveal phase.

3. Reveal phase: The card that you chose in step one is revealed. Another interaction will then get you to Select phase again.

#### Things to improve:

- Fix media queries to fit it better to different screens
- Add animation to result card to make it look like a card turning over
- switch onclick to eventlistners
- try to make the code more semantic
